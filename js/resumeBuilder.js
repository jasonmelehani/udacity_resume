Usually HTML and CSS are taught with a focus on language syntax. But knowing syntax alone does not enable you to create a webpage from a design. You need to know where to start and how to approach the task, in other words - you need to learn how to think like a front-end developer.In this course you will learn how to convert digital design mockups into static web pages. We will teach you how to approach page layout, how to break down a design mockup into page elements, and how to implement that in HTML and CSS.You will also learn about responsive design techniques, which are increasingly important in a world where mobile devices and TV screens are used more and more often to look for information and entertainment.",

You’ll learn actively with our mini projects (see the awesome list below), which you’ll be able to share proudly with your friends. You’ll also learn important programming concepts one by one, with no surprises or leaps of logic along the way.You’ll pick up some great tools for your programming toolkit in this course! You will:Start coding in the programming language Python;Reuse and share code with Object-Oriented Programming;Create and share amazing, life-hacking projects!This introductory course is for you if you want to be a software engineer, or if you want to collaborate with programmers. Mastering Object-Oriented Programming will propel your career in tech forward, and it’s also a great way to learn how software engineers think about solving problems.",

Starting from the basics of how the web works, this course will walk you through core web development concepts such as how internet and browsers fit together, form validations, databases, APIs, integrating with other websites, scaling issues, and more; all of which form part of the knowledge it takes to build a web application of your own.",
